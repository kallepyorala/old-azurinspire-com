Hi, I’m Kalle Pyörälä, professional full stack developer since 1999. I’m from Finland but I’ve been living in France for ten years now.

In my recent [projects](/projects) I’ve been using React, VueJS and Typescript for front end and Laravel and Postgres for backends. I have also developed couple of mobile applications with React Native.

I'm currently available for hire and I'm interested in poth part time and full time propositions. I do only remote work from my home office and I am employee of salary portal [Embarq](https://www.embarq.fr), which can invoice my work internationally.

Check my CV and [book a meeting](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/AzurInspire@NETORGFT7956644.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/), see you soon!
